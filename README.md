### Project Structure
This boilerplate's structure is based off of the [Ducks Pattern](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux).
It allows for redux features to be bundled together in a self-contained matter.
Components are split into Presentational and Container Components (`app/components/` and `app/containers/`, respectfully) as recommended in [this write-up by Dan Abramov](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0).
CSS files are siblings to their components, as each component is nested in its own directory and exposed through the `components/index.js` file.
